      Passionate about full-stack web development and eager to apply my skills, I am a recent MSc Computer Science graduate from the University of Nottingham. 
      Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in data visualization through specialized modules and an impactful independent project. 
      Despite my undergraduate background in marketing, I strategically tailored my coursework to immerse myself in various development experiences, equipping me with the essential skills for software development.
      
      I am currently helping an academic event updating their website to effectively deliver information about the event to the public.
